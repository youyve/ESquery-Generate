                "摘要": "  Hospital length of stay (LOS) is one of the most essential healthcare metrics\nthat reflects the hospital quality of service and helps improve hospital\nscheduling and management. LOS prediction helps in cost management because\npatients who remain in hospitals usually do so in hospital units where\nresources are severely limited. In this study, we reviewed papers on LOS\nprediction using machine learning and statistical approaches. Our literature\nreview considers research studies that focus on LOS prediction for stroke\npatients. Some of the surveyed studies revealed that authors reached\ncontradicting conclusions. For example, the age of the patient was considered\nan important predictor of LOS for stroke patients in some studies, while other\nstudies concluded that age was not a significant factor. Therefore, additional\nresearch is required in this domain to further understand the predictors of LOS\nfor stroke patients.\n",

                "摘要": "  Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for traffic signal control (TSC) have\ngained increasing popularity in recent years. However, most existing RL-based\nTSC methods tend to focus primarily on the RL model structure while neglecting\nthe significance of proper traffic state representation. Furthermore, some\nRL-based methods heavily rely on expert-designed traffic signal phase\ncompetition. In this paper, we present a novel approach to TSC that utilizes\nqueue length as an efficient state representation. We propose two new methods:\n(1) Max Queue-Length (M-QL), an optimization-based traditional method designed\nbased on the property of queue length; and (2) AttentionLight, an RL model that\nemploys the self-attention mechanism to capture the signal phase correlation\nwithout requiring human knowledge of phase relationships. Comprehensive\nexperiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach: (1) the M-QL method outperforms the latest RL-based methods; (2)\nAttentionLight achieves a new state-of-the-art performance; and (3) our results\nhighlight the significance of proper state representation, which is as crucial\nas neural network design in TSC methods. Our findings have important\nimplications for advancing the development of more effective and efficient TSC\nmethods. Our code is released on Github (https://github.\ncom/LiangZhang1996/AttentionLight).\n",

                "摘要": "  Knowledge distillation is initially introduced to utilize additional\nsupervision from a single teacher model for the student model training. To\nboost the student performance, some recent variants attempt to exploit diverse\nknowledge sources from multiple teachers. However, existing studies mainly\nintegrate knowledge from diverse sources by averaging over multiple teacher\npredictions or combining them using other various label-free strategies, which\nmay mislead student in the presence of low-quality teacher predictions. To\ntackle this problem, we propose Confidence-Aware Multi-teacher Knowledge\nDistillation (CA-MKD), which adaptively assigns sample-wise reliability for\neach teacher prediction with the help of ground-truth labels, with those\nteacher predictions close to one-hot labels assigned large weights. Besides,\nCA-MKD incorporates intermediate layers to stable the knowledge transfer\nprocess. Extensive experiments show that our CA-MKD consistently outperforms\nall compared state-of-the-art methods across various teacher-student\narchitectures.\n",

Given the\naggregated inflow and outflow traffic of regions in a city from time slots 0 to\nt-1, we predict the traffic at time t at any region. Prior arts in the area\noften consider the spatial and temporal dependencies in a decoupled manner or\nare rather computationally intensive in training with a large number of\nhyper-parameters to tune. We propose ST-TIS, a novel, lightweight, and accurate\nSpatial-Temporal Transformer with information fusion and region sampling for\ntraffic forecasting. ST-TIS extends the canonical Transformer with information\nfusion and region sampling. The information fusion module captures the complex\nspatial-temporal dependency between regions. The region sampling module is to\nimprove the efficiency and prediction accuracy, cutting the computation\ncomplexity for dependency learning from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n\\sqrt{n})$, where n is\nthe number of regions. With far fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models,\nthe offline training of our model is significantly faster in terms of tuning\nand computation (with a reduction of up to $90\\%$ on training time and network\nparameters). Notwithstanding such training efficiency, extensive experiments\nshow that ST-TIS is substantially more accurate in online prediction than\nstate-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to $9.5\\%$ on\nRMSE, and $12.4\\%$ on MAPE).\n",

EFDLS consists of a\ncentral server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run\ndifferent TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components, namely a feature-based\nstudent-teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM)\nscheme. Within each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its\nteacher's hidden layers to its student's hidden layers via knowledge\ndistillation, with the teacher and student having identical network structure.\nFor each connected user, its student model's hidden layers' weights are\nuploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the\nserver, with the least square distance used to measure the similarity between\nthe weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected\nuser such that the user's and its partner's weights are the closest among all\nthe weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user's and its\npartner's weights to these two users which then load the received weights to\ntheir teachers' hidden layers. Experimental results show that the proposed\nEFDLS achieves excellent performance on a set of selected UCR2018 datasets\nregarding top-1 accuracy.\n",

We propose Multi-Objective Reinforced\nActive Learning (MORAL), a novel method for combining diverse demonstrations of\nsocial norms into a Pareto-optimal policy. Through maintaining a distribution\nover scalarization weights, our approach is able to interactively tune a deep\nRL agent towards a variety of preferences, while eliminating the need for\ncomputing multiple policies. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of\nMORAL in two scenarios, which model a delivery and an emergency task that\nrequire an agent to act in the presence of normative conflicts. Overall, we\nconsider our research a step towards multi-objective RL with learned rewards,\nbridging the gap between current reward learning and machine ethics literature.\n",

Existing POI\nrecommendation and location prediction tasks utilize past information for\nfuture recommendation or prediction from a single direction perspective, while\nthe missing POI category identification task needs to utilize the check-in\ninformation both before and after the missing category. Therefore, a\nlong-standing challenge is how to effectively identify the missing POI\ncategories at any time in the real-world check-in data of mobile users. To this\nend, in this paper, we propose a novel neural network approach to identify the\nmissing POI categories by integrating both bi-directional global non-personal\ntransition patterns and personal preferences of users. Specifically, we\ndelicately design an attention matching cell to model how well the check-in\ncategory information matches their non-personal transition patterns and\npersonal preferences. Finally, we evaluate our model on two real-world\ndatasets, which clearly validate its effectiveness compared with the\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

                "摘要": "  Log anomaly detection is a key component in the field of artificial\nintelligence for IT operations (AIOps). Considering log data of variant\ndomains, retraining the whole network for unknown domains is inefficient in\nreal industrial scenarios especially for low-resource domains. However,\nprevious deep models merely focused on extracting the semantics of log sequence\nin the same domain, leading to poor generalization on multi-domain logs.\nTherefore, we propose a unified Transformer-based framework for log anomaly\ndetection (\\ourmethod{}), which is comprised of the pretraining and\nadapter-based tuning stage. Our model is first pretrained on the source domain\nto obtain shared semantic knowledge of log data. Then, we transfer the\npretrained model to the target domain via the adapter-based tuning. The\nproposed method is evaluated on three public datasets including one source\ndomain and two target domains. The experimental results demonstrate that our\nsimple yet efficient approach, with fewer trainable parameters and lower\ntraining costs in the target domain, achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthree benchmarks.\n",

Existing inverse reinforcement learning algorithms come with\nstrong theoretical guarantees, but are computationally expensive because they\nuse reinforcement learning or planning algorithms as a subroutine. On the other\nhand, state-of-the-art policy gradient based algorithms (like IM-REINFORCE,\nIM-TRPO, and GAIL), achieve significant empirical success in challenging\nbenchmark tasks, but are not well understood in terms of theory. With an\nemphasis on non-asymptotic guarantees of performance, we propose a method that\ndirectly learns a policy from expert demonstrations, bypassing the intermediate\nstep of learning the cost function, by formulating the problem as a single\nconvex optimization problem over occupancy measures.

It is common for people to\nexperience scalp problems that include Dandruff, Psoriasis, Tinea-Capitis,\nAlopecia and Atopic-Dermatitis. In accordance with WHO research, approximately\n70% of adults have problems with their scalp. It has been demonstrated in\ndescriptive research that hair quality is impaired by impaired scalp, but these\nimpacts are reversible with early diagnosis and treatment. Deep Learning\nadvances have demonstrated the effectiveness of CNN paired with FCN in\ndiagnosing scalp and skin disorders. In one proposed Deep-Learning-based scalp\ninspection and diagnosis system, an imaging microscope and a trained model are\ncombined with an app that classifies scalp disorders accurately with an average\nprecision of 97.41%- 99.09%. Another research dealt with classifying the\nPsoriasis using the CNN with an accuracy of 82.9%. As part of another study, an\nML based algorithm was also employed. It accurately classified the healthy\nscalp and alopecia areata with 91.4% and 88.9% accuracy with SVM and KNN\nalgorithms. Using deep learning models to diagnose scalp related diseases has\nimproved due to advancements i computation capabilities and computer vision,\nbut there remains a wide horizon for further improvements.\n",

We found that age, gender, and geographical region\nof residence were significant demographic factors influencing the likelihood of\ndeveloping mental health disorders in post-COVID-19 patients. Additionally,\ncomorbidities and the severity of COVID-19 illness were important clinical\npredictors. Psychosocial factors, such as social support, coping strategies,\nand perceived stress levels, also played a substantial role. Our findings\nemphasize the complex interplay of multiple factors in the development of\nmental health disorders following COVID-19 recovery.

In this era of ubiquitous\ndata and information, how to obtain and analyze these data has become the\nresearch topic of many people. In view of this situation, this paper makes some\nbrief overviews of machine learning-related recommendation systems. By\nanalyzing some technologies and ideas used by machine learning in recommender\nsystems, let more people understand what is Big data and what is machine\nlearning. The most important point is to let everyone understand the profound\nimpact of machine learning on our daily life.\n",

                "摘要": "  Reliability of machine learning evaluation -- the consistency of observed\nevaluation scores across replicated model training runs -- is affected by\nseveral sources of nondeterminism which can be regarded as measurement noise.\nCurrent tendencies to remove noise in order to enforce reproducibility of\nresearch results neglect inherent nondeterminism at the implementation level\nand disregard crucial interaction effects between algorithmic noise factors and\ndata properties. This limits the scope of conclusions that can be drawn from\nsuch experiments. Instead of removing noise, we propose to incorporate several\nsources of variance, including their interaction with data properties, into an\nanalysis of significance and reliability of machine learning evaluation, with\nthe aim to draw inferences beyond particular instances of trained models. We\nshow how to use linear mixed effects models (LMEMs) to analyze performance\nevaluation scores, and to conduct statistical inference with a generalized\nlikelihood ratio test (GLRT). This allows us to incorporate arbitrary sources\nof noise like meta-parameter variations into statistical significance testing,\nand to assess performance differences conditional on data properties.\nFurthermore, a variance component analysis (VCA) enables the analysis of the\ncontribution of noise sources to overall variance and the computation of a\nreliability coefficient by the ratio of substantial to total variance.\n",

                "摘要": "  This article provides a curated review of selected papers published in\nprominent economics journals that use machine learning (ML) tools for research\nand policy analysis. The review focuses on three key questions: (1) when ML is\nused in economics, (2) what ML models are commonly preferred, and (3) how they\nare used for economic applications. The review highlights that ML is\nparticularly used to process nontraditional and unstructured data, capture\nstrong nonlinearity, and improve prediction accuracy. Deep learning models are\nsuitable for nontraditional data, whereas ensemble learning models are\npreferred for traditional datasets. While traditional econometric models may\nsuffice for analyzing low-complexity data, the increasing complexity of\neconomic data due to rapid digitalization and the growing literature suggests\nthat ML is becoming an essential addition to the econometrician's toolbox.\n",

                "摘要": "  Goal: Numerous studies had successfully differentiated normal and abnormal\nvoice samples. Nevertheless, further classification had rarely been attempted.\nThis study proposes a novel approach, using continuous Mandarin speech instead\nof a single vowel, to classify four common voice disorders (i.e. functional\ndysphonia, neoplasm, phonotrauma, and vocal palsy). Methods: In the proposed\nframework, acoustic signals are transformed into mel-frequency cepstral\ncoefficients, and a bi-directional long-short term memory network (BiLSTM) is\nadopted to model the sequential features. The experiments were conducted on a\nlarge-scale database, wherein 1,045 continuous speech were collected by the\nspeech clinic of a hospital from 2012 to 2019. Results: Experimental results\ndemonstrated that the proposed framework yields significant accuracy and\nunweighted average recall improvements of 78.12-89.27% and 50.92-80.68%,\nrespectively, compared with systems that use a single vowel. Conclusions: The\nresults are consistent with other machine learning algorithms, including gated\nrecurrent units, random forest, deep neural networks, and LSTM. The\nsensitivities for each disorder were also analyzed, and the model capabilities\nwere visualized via principal component analysis. An alternative experiment\nbased on a balanced dataset again confirms the advantages of using continuous\nspeech for learning voice disorders.\n",

Today's scientific challenges are characterised by complexity.\nInterconnected natural, technological, and human systems are influenced by\nforces acting across time- and spatial-scales, resulting in complex\ninteractions and emergent behaviours. Understanding these phenomena -- and\nleveraging scientific advances to deliver innovative solutions to improve\nsociety's health, wealth, and well-being -- requires new ways of analysing\ncomplex systems. The transformative potential of AI stems from its widespread\napplicability across disciplines, and will only be achieved through integration\nacross research domains. AI for science is a rendezvous point. It brings\ntogether expertise from $\\mathrm{AI}$ and application domains; combines\nmodelling knowledge with engineering know-how; and relies on collaboration\nacross disciplines and between humans and machines. Alongside technical\nadvances, the next wave of progress in the field will come from building a\ncommunity of machine learning researchers, domain experts, citizen scientists,\nand engineers working together to design and deploy effective AI tools. This\nreport summarises the discussions from the seminar and provides a roadmap to\nsuggest how different communities can collaborate to deliver a new wave of\nprogress in AI and its application for scientific discovery.\n",

However, they\nstill face two major challenges: hallucination and outdated information after\nthe training phase. These challenges take center stage in critical domains like\nclimate change, where obtaining accurate and up-to-date information from\nreliable sources in a limited time is essential and difficult. To overcome\nthese barriers, one potential solution is to provide LLMs with access to\nexternal, scientifically accurate, and robust sources (long-term memory) to\ncontinuously update their knowledge and prevent the propagation of inaccurate,\nincorrect, or outdated information. In this study, we enhanced GPT-4 by\nintegrating the information from the Sixth Assessment Report of the\nIntergovernmental (IPCC AR6), the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and reliable\nsource in this domain. We present our conversational AI prototype, available at\nwww.chatclimate.ai and demonstrate its ability to answer challenging questions\naccurately in three different QA scenarios: asking from 1) GPT-4, 2)\nchatClimate, and 3) hybrid chatClimate. The answers and their sources were\nevaluated by our team of IPCC authors, who used their expert knowledge to score\nthe accuracy of the answers from 1 (very-low) to 5 (very-high). The evaluation\nshowed that the hybrid chatClimate provided more accurate answers, highlighting\nthe effectiveness of our solution. This approach can be easily scaled for\nchatbots in specific domains, enabling the delivery of reliable and accurate\ninformation.\n",

An AI system that can enable students to ask\nquestions via text or voice and get instant answers will make high-quality\neducation accessible. Despite advances in the field of AI, there exists no\nrobust benchmark or challenge to enable building such an (EQA) AI within the\nAfrican context. Ghana's National Science and Maths Quiz competition (NSMQ) is\nthe perfect competition to evaluate the potential of such an AI due to its wide\ncoverage of scientific fields, variety of question types, highly competitive\nnature, and live, real-world format. The NSMQ is a Jeopardy-style annual live\nquiz competition in which 3 teams of 2 students compete by answering questions\nacross biology, chemistry, physics, and math in 5 rounds over 5 progressive\nstages until a winning team is crowned for that year. In this position paper,\nwe propose the NSMQ AI Grand Challenge, an AI Grand Challenge for Education\nusing Ghana's National Science and Maths Quiz competition (NSMQ) as a case\nstudy. Our proposed grand challenge is to \"Build an AI to compete live in\nGhana's National Science and Maths Quiz (NSMQ) competition and win - performing\nbetter than the best contestants in all rounds and stages of the competition.\"\nWe describe the competition, and key technical challenges to address along with\nideas from recent advances in machine learning that could be leveraged to solve\nthis challenge.

                "摘要": "  Artificial Intelligence for Science (AI4S) is an emerging research field that\nutilizes machine learning advancements to tackle complex scientific\ncomputational issues, aiming to enhance computational efficiency and accuracy.\nHowever, the data-driven nature of AI4S lacks the correctness or accuracy\nassurances of conventional scientific computing, posing challenges when\ndeploying AI4S models in real-world applications. To mitigate these, more\ncomprehensive benchmarking procedures are needed to better understand AI4S\nmodels. This paper introduces a novel benchmarking approach, known as\nstructural interpretation, which addresses two key requirements: identifying\nthe trusted operating range in the problem space and tracing errors back to\ntheir computational components. This method partitions both the problem and\nmetric spaces, facilitating a structural exploration of these spaces. The\npractical utility and effectiveness of structural interpretation are\nillustrated through its application to three distinct AI4S workloads:\nmachine-learning force fields (MLFF), jet tagging, and precipitation\nnowcasting. The benchmarks effectively model the trusted operating range, trace\nerrors, and reveal novel perspectives for refining the model, training process,\nand data sampling strategy. This work is part of the SAIBench project, an AI4S\nbenchmarking suite.\n",
