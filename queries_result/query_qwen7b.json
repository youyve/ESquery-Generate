                "摘要": "  Hospital length of stay (LOS) is one of the most essential healthcare metrics\nthat reflects the hospital quality of service and helps improve hospital\nscheduling and management. LOS prediction helps in cost management because\npatients who remain in hospitals usually do so in hospital units where\nresources are severely limited. In this study, we reviewed papers on LOS\nprediction using machine learning and statistical approaches. Our literature\nreview considers research studies that focus on LOS prediction for stroke\npatients. Some of the surveyed studies revealed that authors reached\ncontradicting conclusions. For example, the age of the patient was considered\nan important predictor of LOS for stroke patients in some studies, while other\nstudies concluded that age was not a significant factor. Therefore, additional\nresearch is required in this domain to further understand the predictors of LOS\nfor stroke patients.\n",

                "摘要": "  Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for traffic signal control (TSC) have\ngained increasing popularity in recent years. However, most existing RL-based\nTSC methods tend to focus primarily on the RL model structure while neglecting\nthe significance of proper traffic state representation. Furthermore, some\nRL-based methods heavily rely on expert-designed traffic signal phase\ncompetition. In this paper, we present a novel approach to TSC that utilizes\nqueue length as an efficient state representation. We propose two new methods:\n(1) Max Queue-Length (M-QL), an optimization-based traditional method designed\nbased on the property of queue length; and (2) AttentionLight, an RL model that\nemploys the self-attention mechanism to capture the signal phase correlation\nwithout requiring human knowledge of phase relationships. Comprehensive\nexperiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach: (1) the M-QL method outperforms the latest RL-based methods; (2)\nAttentionLight achieves a new state-of-the-art performance; and (3) our results\nhighlight the significance of proper state representation, which is as crucial\nas neural network design in TSC methods. Our findings have important\nimplications for advancing the development of more effective and efficient TSC\nmethods.

                "摘要": "  Knowledge distillation is initially introduced to utilize additional\nsupervision from a single teacher model for the student model training. To\nboost the student performance, some recent variants attempt to exploit diverse\nknowledge sources from multiple teachers. However, existing studies mainly\nintegrate knowledge from diverse sources by averaging over multiple teacher\npredictions or combining them using other various label-free strategies, which\nmay mislead student in the presence of low-quality teacher predictions. To\ntackle this problem, we propose Confidence-Aware Multi-teacher Knowledge\nDistillation (CA-MKD), which adaptively assigns sample-wise reliability for\neach teacher prediction with the help of ground-truth labels, with those\nteacher predictions close to one-hot labels assigned large weights. Besides,\nCA-MKD incorporates intermediate layers to stable the knowledge transfer\nprocess. Extensive experiments show that our CA-MKD consistently outperforms\nall compared state-of-the-art methods across various teacher-student\narchitectures.\n",

Given the\naggregated inflow and outflow traffic of regions in a city from time slots 0 to\nt-1, we predict the traffic at time t at any region. Prior arts in the area\noften consider the spatial and temporal dependencies in a decoupled manner or\nare rather computationally intensive in training with a large number of\nhyper-parameters to tune. We propose ST-TIS, a novel, lightweight, and accurate\nSpatial-Temporal Transformer with information fusion and region sampling for\ntraffic forecasting. ST-TIS extends the canonical Transformer with information\nfusion and region sampling. The information fusion module captures the complex\nspatial-temporal dependency between regions. The region sampling module is to\nimprove the efficiency and prediction accuracy, cutting the computation\ncomplexity for dependency learning from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n\\sqrt{n})$, where n is\nthe number of regions. With far fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models,\nthe offline training of our model is significantly faster in terms of tuning\nand computation (with a reduction of up to $90\\%$ on training time and network\nparameters). Notwithstanding such training efficiency, extensive experiments\nshow that ST-TIS is substantially more accurate in online prediction than\nstate-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to $9.5\\%$ on\nRMSE, and $12.4\\%$ on MAPE).\n",

EFDLS consists of a\ncentral server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run\ndifferent TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components, namely a feature-based\nstudent-teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM)\nscheme. Within each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its\nteacher's hidden layers to its student's hidden layers via knowledge\ndistillation, with the teacher and student having identical network structure.\nFor each connected user, its student model's hidden layers' weights are\nuploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the\nserver, with the least square distance used to measure the similarity between\nthe weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected\nuser such that the user's and its partner's weights are the closest among all\nthe weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user's and its\npartner's weights to these two users which then load the received weights to\ntheir teachers' hidden layers. Experimental results show that the proposed\nEFDLS achieves excellent performance on a set of selected UCR2018 datasets\nregarding top-1 accuracy.\n",

We propose Multi-Objective Reinforced\nActive Learning (MORAL), a novel method for combining diverse demonstrations of\nsocial norms into a Pareto-optimal policy. Through maintaining a distribution\nover scalarization weights, our approach is able to interactively tune a deep\nRL agent towards a variety of preferences, while eliminating the need for\ncomputing multiple policies. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of\nMORAL in two scenarios, which model a delivery and an emergency task that\nrequire an agent to act in the presence of normative conflicts.

Existing POI\nrecommendation and location prediction tasks utilize past information for\nfuture recommendation or prediction from a single direction perspective, while\nthe missing POI category identification task needs to utilize the check-in\ninformation both before and after the missing category. Therefore, a\nlong-standing challenge is how to effectively identify the missing POI\ncategories at any time in the real-world check-in data of mobile users. To this\nend, in this paper, we propose a novel neural network approach to identify the\nmissing POI categories by integrating both bi-directional global non-personal\ntransition patterns and personal preferences of users. Specifically, we\ndelicately design an attention matching cell to model how well the check-in\ncategory information matches their non-personal transition patterns and\npersonal preferences. Finally, we evaluate our model on two real-world\ndatasets, which clearly validate its effectiveness compared with the\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

Considering log data of variant\ndomains, retraining the whole network for unknown domains is inefficient in\nreal industrial scenarios especially for low-resource domains. However,\nprevious deep models merely focused on extracting the semantics of log sequence\nin the same domain, leading to poor generalization on multi-domain logs.\nTherefore, we propose a unified Transformer-based framework for log anomaly\ndetection (\\ourmethod{}), which is comprised of the pretraining and\nadapter-based tuning stage. Our model is first pretrained on the source domain\nto obtain shared semantic knowledge of log data. Then, we transfer the\npretrained model to the target domain via the adapter-based tuning. The\nproposed method is evaluated on three public datasets including one source\ndomain and two target domains. The experimental results demonstrate that our\nsimple yet efficient approach, with fewer trainable parameters and lower\ntraining costs in the target domain, achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthree benchmarks.\n",

With an\nemphasis on non-asymptotic guarantees of performance, we propose a method that\ndirectly learns a policy from expert demonstrations, bypassing the intermediate\nstep of learning the cost function, by formulating the problem as a single\nconvex optimization problem over occupancy measures.

The lack of competency awareness makes NMT untrustworthy.\nThis is in sharp contrast to human translators who give feedback or conduct\nfurther investigations whenever they are in doubt about predictions. To fill\nthis gap, we propose a novel competency-aware NMT by extending conventional NMT\nwith a self-estimator, offering abilities to translate a source sentence and\nestimate its competency. The self-estimator encodes the information of the\ndecoding procedure and then examines whether it can reconstruct the original\nsemantics of the source sentence. Experimental results on four translation\ntasks demonstrate that the proposed method not only carries out translation\ntasks intact but also delivers outstanding performance on quality estimation.\nWithout depending on any reference or annotated data typically required by\nstate-of-the-art metric and quality estimation methods, our model yields an\neven higher correlation with human quality judgments than a variety of\naforementioned methods, such as BLEURT, COMET, and BERTScore. Quantitative and\nqualitative analyses show better robustness of competency awareness in our\nmodel.\n",

For QE in particular, high-quality labeled data is often lacking due to\nthe high cost and effort associated with labeling such data. Aside from the\ndata scarcity challenge, QE models should also be generalizable, i.e., they\nshould be able to handle data from different domains, both generic and\nspecific.

                "摘要": "  How best to evaluate synthesized images has been a longstanding problem in\nimage-to-image translation, and to date remains largely unresolved. This paper\nproposes a novel approach that combines signals of image quality between paired\nsource and transformation to predict the latter's similarity with a\nhypothetical ground truth. We trained a Multi-Method Fusion (MMF) model via an\nensemble of gradient-boosted regressors using Image Quality Assessment (IQA)\nmetrics to predict Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS),\nenabling models to be ranked without the need for ground truth data. Analysis\nrevealed the task to be feature-constrained, introducing a trade-off at\ninference between metric computation time and prediction accuracy. The MMF\nmodel we present offers an efficient way to automate the evaluation of\nsynthesized images, and by extension the image-to-image translation models that\ngenerated them.\n",

In many regions, implementing\nsuch systems can be difficult due to the lack of centralization and automation\nof postharvest supply chains. Stakeholders are often too small to specialize in\nmachine learning, and large training data sets are unavailable. We propose a\nmachine learning procedure for images based on pre-trained Vision Transformers.\nIt is easier to implement than the current standard approach of training\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as we do not (re-)train deep neural\nnetworks. We evaluate our approach based on two data sets for apple defect\ndetection and banana ripeness estimation. Our model achieves a competitive\nclassification accuracy equal to or less than one percent below the\nbest-performing CNN. At the same time, it requires three times fewer training\nsamples to achieve a 90% accuracy.\n",

                "摘要": "  In the current IT world, developers write code while system operators run the\ncode mostly as a black box. The connection between both worlds is typically\nestablished with log messages: the developer provides hints to the (unknown)\noperator, where the cause of an occurred issue is, and vice versa, the operator\ncan report bugs during operation. To fulfil this purpose, developers write log\ninstructions that are structured text commonly composed of a log level (e.g.,\n\"info\", \"error\"), static text (\"IP {} cannot be reached\"), and dynamic\nvariables (e.g. IP {}). However, as opposed to well-adopted coding practices,\nthere are no widely adopted guidelines on how to write log instructions with\ngood quality properties. For example, a developer may assign a high log level\n(e.g., \"error\") for a trivial event that can confuse the operator and increase\nmaintenance costs. Or the static text can be insufficient to hint at a specific\nissue. In this paper, we address the problem of log quality assessment and\nprovide the first step towards its automation. We start with an in-depth\nanalysis of quality log instruction properties in nine software systems and\nidentify two quality properties: 1) correct log level assignment assessing the\ncorrectness of the log level, and 2) sufficient linguistic structure assessing\nthe minimal richness of the static text necessary for verbose event\ndescription. Based on these findings, we developed a data-driven approach that\nadapts deep learning methods for each of the two properties. An extensive\nevaluation on large-scale open-source systems shows that our approach correctly\nassesses log level assignments with an accuracy of 0.88, and the sufficient\nlinguistic structure with an F1 score of 0.99, outperforming the baselines. Our\nstudy shows the potential of the data-driven methods in assessing instructions\nquality and aid developers in comprehending and writing better code.\n",

For example, the age of the patient was considered\nan important predictor of LOS for stroke patients in some studies, while other\nstudies concluded that age was not a significant factor.

However, most existing RL-based\nTSC methods tend to focus primarily on the RL model structure while neglecting\nthe significance of proper traffic state representation. Furthermore, some\nRL-based methods heavily rely on expert-designed traffic signal phase\ncompetition. In this paper, we present a novel approach to TSC that utilizes\nqueue length as an efficient state representation. We propose two new methods:\n(1) Max Queue-Length (M-QL), an optimization-based traditional method designed\nbased on the property of queue length; and (2) AttentionLight, an RL model that\nemploys the self-attention mechanism to capture the signal phase correlation\nwithout requiring human knowledge of phase relationships. Comprehensive\nexperiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach: (1) the M-QL method outperforms the latest RL-based methods; (2)\nAttentionLight achieves a new state-of-the-art performance; and (3) our results\nhighlight the significance of proper state representation, which is as crucial\nas neural network design in TSC methods.

To\nboost the student performance, some recent variants attempt to exploit diverse\nknowledge sources from multiple teachers.

To\ntackle this problem, we propose Confidence-Aware Multi-teacher Knowledge\nDistillation (CA-MKD), which adaptively assigns sample-wise reliability for\neach teacher prediction with the help of ground-truth labels, with those\nteacher predictions close to one-hot labels assigned large weights. Besides,\nCA-MKD incorporates intermediate layers to stable the knowledge transfer\nprocess. Extensive experiments show that our CA-MKD consistently outperforms\nall compared state-of-the-art methods across various teacher-student\narchitectures.\n",

Given the\naggregated inflow and outflow traffic of regions in a city from time slots 0 to\nt-1, we predict the traffic at time t at any region. Prior arts in the area\noften consider the spatial and temporal dependencies in a decoupled manner or\nare rather computationally intensive in training with a large number of\nhyper-parameters to tune. We propose ST-TIS, a novel, lightweight, and accurate\nSpatial-Temporal Transformer with information fusion and region sampling for\ntraffic forecasting. ST-TIS extends the canonical Transformer with information\nfusion and region sampling. The information fusion module captures the complex\nspatial-temporal dependency between regions. The region sampling module is to\nimprove the efficiency and prediction accuracy, cutting the computation\ncomplexity for dependency learning from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n\\sqrt{n})$, where n is\nthe number of regions. With far fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models,\nthe offline training of our model is significantly faster in terms of tuning\nand computation (with a reduction of up to $90\\%$ on training time and network\nparameters). Notwithstanding such training efficiency, extensive experiments\nshow that ST-TIS is substantially more accurate in online prediction than\nstate-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to $9.5\\%$ on\nRMSE, and $12.4\\%$ on MAPE).\n",

EFDLS consists of a\ncentral server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run\ndifferent TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components, namely a feature-based\nstudent-teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM)\nscheme. Within each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its\nteacher's hidden layers to its student's hidden layers via knowledge\ndistillation, with the teacher and student having identical network structure.\nFor each connected user, its student model's hidden layers' weights are\nuploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the\nserver, with the least square distance used to measure the similarity between\nthe weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected\nuser such that the user's and its partner's weights are the closest among all\nthe weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user's and its\npartner's weights to these two users which then load the received weights to\ntheir teachers' hidden layers. Experimental results show that the proposed\nEFDLS achieves excellent performance on a set of selected UCR2018 datasets\nregarding top-1 accuracy.\n",

The existing methods highly rely on\nexperimental protein structure data and fail in scenarios where these data are\nunavailable. Predicted protein structures from AI tools (e.g., AlphaFold2) were\nutilized as alternatives. However, we observed that current practices, which\nsimply employ accurately predicted structures during inference, suffer from\nnotable degradation in prediction accuracy. While similar phenomena have been\nextensively studied in general fields (e.g., Computer Vision) as model\nrobustness, their impact on protein property prediction remains unexplored.

                "摘要": "  Proteins are essential component of human life and their structures are\nimportant for function and mechanism analysis. Recent work has shown the\npotential of AI-driven methods for protein structure prediction. However, the\ndevelopment of new models is restricted by the lack of dataset and benchmark\ntraining procedure. To the best of our knowledge, the existing open source\ndatasets are far less to satisfy the needs of modern protein sequence-structure\nrelated research. To solve this problem, we present the first million-level\nprotein structure prediction dataset with high coverage and diversity, named as\nPSP. This dataset consists of 570k true structure sequences (10TB) and 745k\ncomplementary distillation sequences (15TB). We provide in addition the\nbenchmark training procedure for SOTA protein structure prediction model on\nthis dataset. We validate the utility of this dataset for training by\nparticipating CAMEO contest in which our model won the first place. We hope our\nPSP dataset together with the training benchmark can enable a broader community\nof AI/biology researchers for AI-driven protein related research.\n",

                "摘要": "  AI-based protein structure prediction pipelines, such as AlphaFold2, have\nachieved near-experimental accuracy. These advanced pipelines mainly rely on\nMultiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) as inputs to learn the co-evolution\ninformation from the homologous sequences. Nonetheless, searching MSAs from\nprotein databases is time-consuming, usually taking dozens of minutes.\nConsequently, we attempt to explore the limits of fast protein structure\nprediction by using only primary sequences of proteins. HelixFold-Single is\nproposed to combine a large-scale protein language model with the superior\ngeometric learning capability of AlphaFold2. Our proposed method,\nHelixFold-Single, first pre-trains a large-scale protein language model (PLM)\nwith thousands of millions of primary sequences utilizing the self-supervised\nlearning paradigm, which will be used as an alternative to MSAs for learning\nthe co-evolution information. Then, by combining the pre-trained PLM and the\nessential components of AlphaFold2, we obtain an end-to-end differentiable\nmodel to predict the 3D coordinates of atoms from only the primary sequence.\nHelixFold-Single is validated in datasets CASP14 and CAMEO, achieving\ncompetitive accuracy with the MSA-based methods on the targets with large\nhomologous families. Furthermore, HelixFold-Single consumes much less time than\nthe mainstream pipelines for protein structure prediction, demonstrating its\npotential in tasks requiring many predictions. The code of HelixFold-Single is\navailable at\nhttps://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleHelix/tree/dev/apps/protein_folding/helixfold-single,\nand we also provide stable web services on\nhttps://paddlehelix.baidu.com/app/drug/protein-single/forecast.\n",

                "摘要": "  Protein structure prediction has reached revolutionary levels of accuracy on\nsingle structures, yet distributional modeling paradigms are needed to capture\nthe conformational ensembles and flexibility that underlie biological function.\nTowards this goal, we develop EigenFold, a diffusion generative modeling\nframework for sampling a distribution of structures from a given protein\nsequence. We define a diffusion process that models the structure as a system\nof harmonic oscillators and which naturally induces a cascading-resolution\ngenerative process along the eigenmodes of the system. On recent CAMEO targets,\nEigenFold achieves a median TMScore of 0.84, while providing a more\ncomprehensive picture of model uncertainty via the ensemble of sampled\nstructures relative to existing methods. We then assess EigenFold's ability to\nmodel and predict conformational heterogeneity for fold-switching proteins and\nligand-induced conformational change.

Advances in the\ntransformer neural network architecture -- such as AlphaFold2 -- achieve\nsignificant improvements for this problem, by learning from a large dataset of\nsequence information and corresponding protein structures. Yet, such methods\nonly focus on sequence information; other available prior knowledge, such as\nprotein crystallography and partial structure of amino acids, could be\npotentially utilized. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first\ntransformer-based model that directly utilizes protein crystallography and\npartial structure information to predict the electron density maps of proteins.\nVia two new datasets of peptide fragments (2-residue and 15-residue) , we\ndemonstrate our method, dubbed \\texttt{CrysFormer}, can achieve accurate\npredictions, based on a much smaller dataset size and with reduced computation\ncosts.\n",

                "摘要": "  The prediction of protein structures from sequences is an important task for\nfunction prediction, drug design, and related biological processes\nunderstanding. Recent advances have proved the power of language models (LMs)\nin processing the protein sequence databases, which inherit the advantages of\nattention networks and capture useful information in learning representations\nfor proteins. The past two years have witnessed remarkable success in tertiary\nprotein structure prediction (PSP), including evolution-based and\nsingle-sequence-based PSP. It seems that instead of using energy-based models\nand sampling procedures, protein language model (pLM)-based pipelines have\nemerged as mainstream paradigms in PSP. Despite the fruitful progress, the PSP\ncommunity needs a systematic and up-to-date survey to help bridge the gap\nbetween LMs in the natural language processing (NLP) and PSP domains and\nintroduce their methodologies, advancements and practical applications. To this\nend, in this paper, we first introduce the similarities between protein and\nhuman languages that allow LMs extended to pLMs, and applied to protein\ndatabases. Then, we systematically review recent advances in LMs and pLMs from\nthe perspectives of network architectures, pre-training strategies,\napplications, and commonly-used protein databases. Next, different types of\nmethods for PSP are discussed, particularly how the pLM-based architectures\nfunction in the process of protein folding. Finally, we identify challenges\nfaced by the PSP community and foresee promising research directions along with\nthe advances of pLMs. This survey aims to be a hands-on guide for researchers\nto understand PSP methods, develop pLMs and tackle challenging problems in this\nfield for practical purposes.\n",

                "摘要": "  The goal of Protein Structure Prediction (PSP) problem is to predict a\nprotein's 3D structure (confirmation) from its amino acid sequence. The problem\nhas been a 'holy grail' of science since the Noble prize-winning work of\nAnfinsen demonstrated that protein conformation was determined by sequence. A\nrecent and important step towards this goal was the development of AlphaFold2,\ncurrently the best PSP method. AlphaFold2 is probably the highest profile\napplication of AI to science. Both AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold (another\nimpressive PSP method) have been published and placed in the public domain\n(code & models). Stacking is a form of ensemble machine learning ML in which\nmultiple baseline models are first learnt, then a meta-model is learnt using\nthe outputs of the baseline level model to form a model that outperforms the\nbase models. Stacking has been successful in many applications. We developed\nthe ARStack PSP method by stacking AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold. ARStack\nsignificantly outperforms AlphaFold2. We rigorously demonstrate this using two\nsets of non-homologous proteins, and a test set of protein structures published\nafter that of AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold. As more high quality prediction\nmethods are published it is likely that ensemble methods will increasingly\noutperform any single method.\n",
